#A Simplified Implementation of the Bollinger Bands Problem
The [Bollinger Bands] (http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:bollinger_bands) is a method of analysing stocks. It requires the calculation of a simple moving average and the standard deviation. When plotted on a graph, there will be three bands visible, the middle band, which is the simple moving average, the upper band, which is two standard deviations above the average, and the lower band, which is two standard deviations below the average. The individual data points are then plotted on top of this graph.

Our implementation simplifies the problem by taking an average of the adjusted close prices per month instead of a moving average.

#Volatility
This problem requires the calculation of standard deviations, which is also a measure of volatility. A high standard deviation in the price of stocks of a certain company can help determine which stocks are “risky” (volatile) stocks, or safe stocks. We took stock data from prominent companies such as Facebook, Apple, and Google.
